# Security Architecture

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based Authentication**: Secure session management with Redis storage
- **Password Security**: Argon2 hashing with salt for credential storage
- **Role-based Access Control**: Hierarchical permissions (owner, editor, viewer)
- **API Security**: Request rate limiting and input validation

## Data Protection
- **Database Security**: Encrypted connections and parameterized queries
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS 1.3 for all client-server communication
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted cross-origin access policies
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs

## Operational Security
- **Secrets Management**: Environment-based configuration with secret rotation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive change tracking and access logging
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database backups with encryption
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular dependency and container security scans
