# Performance Requirements

## Response Time Targets
- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds for initial page rendering
- **API Responses**: < 500ms for standard CRUD operations
- **Real-time Updates**: < 100ms WebSocket message propagation
- **Export Generation**: < 30 seconds for standard project exports

## Concurrency Support
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 50+ simultaneous users per project
- **WebSocket Connections**: 1000+ concurrent real-time connections
- **Database Load**: Optimized for 100+ queries per second
- **File Operations**: Parallel export processing for multiple formats

## Resource Optimization
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB base memory footprint per container
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling with max 20 connections per instance
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: > 90% cache hit rate for frequently accessed data
- **Network Efficiency**: Compressed payloads and efficient WebSocket messaging

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building the OOUX ORCA Project Builder with scalability, security, and performance in mind. The design supports the collaborative nature of OOUX methodology while maintaining the technical requirements outlined in the PRD.
