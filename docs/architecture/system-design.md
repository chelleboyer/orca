# High-Level System Design

## System Architecture Overview

The OOUX ORCA Project Builder follows a modern web application architecture with the following key characteristics:

- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers
- **Event-Driven Design**: Real-time collaboration through WebSocket events and message broadcasting
- **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP endpoints for CRUD operations and resource management
- **Database-First Approach**: Relational data modeling reflecting OOUX domain concepts

## Core System Components

### 1. Web Application Layer
- **FastAPI Application**: Main application server handling HTTP requests and WebSocket connections
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2-based server-side rendering with HTMX enhancement
- **Static Asset Management**: CSS, JavaScript, and image serving with proper caching headers
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Session-based authentication with role-based access control

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **Project Management**: Project lifecycle, user access, and workspace management
- **ORCA Matrix Engine**: Core logic for Objects, Relationships, CTAs, and Attributes
- **Collaboration Engine**: Real-time synchronization, conflict resolution, and user presence
- **Export Engine**: Multi-format document generation and data transformation

### 3. Data Access Layer
- **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy ORM models representing OOUX domain entities
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction for testability and maintainability
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connection management
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data

### 4. Real-Time Communication Layer
- **WebSocket Manager**: Connection lifecycle management and message routing
- **Event Broadcasting**: Pub/sub pattern for real-time matrix updates
- **Presence Management**: User online status and active workspace tracking
- **Conflict Resolution**: Operational transformation for concurrent edits

## Data Flow Architecture

### Request Processing Flow
1. **HTTP Request** → FastAPI Router → Business Logic → Data Layer → Response
2. **WebSocket Event** → Connection Manager → Event Handler → Broadcast → Clients
3. **Database Transaction** → SQLAlchemy Session → PostgreSQL → Commit/Rollback
4. **Cache Operations** → Redis Client → In-Memory Storage → Response

### Real-Time Collaboration Flow
1. **User Action** → Frontend Event → WebSocket Message → Server Processing
2. **Server Processing** → Business Logic → Database Update → Event Generation
3. **Event Broadcasting** → WebSocket Manager → Connected Clients → UI Update
4. **Conflict Detection** → Merge Strategy → Resolution → State Synchronization
