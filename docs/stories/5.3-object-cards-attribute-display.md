## Story Overview

**Epic**: 5 - Attributes & Object Map Visualization  
**Story**: 5.3 - Object Cards & Attribute Display  
**Status**: ÔøΩ **IN PROGRESS**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025  
**Started**: September 3, 2025

## User Story

As a **team member**,
I want **to see object information in card format with key details**,
So that **I can quickly understand object structure without detailed editing**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Object cards show name, definition summary** core attributes, and relationship count
2. **Card view supports grid and list layouts** for different use cases
3. **Filtering by attributes, relationships, or states** helps find relevant objects

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Cards indicate completion status** (has definition, attributes, relationships)
5. **Quick actions on cards enable common operations** without full editing
6. **Card design supports responsive display** on various screen sizes

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Card layout is visually appealing** and information-dense
8. **Filtering performance is fast** even with many objects
9. **Quick actions work reliably** without interface conflicts

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Build on Epic 5.1 attributes and existing Object Catalog
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Dashboard card patterns and object display
- **Key Constraints**: Must work with completed object and attribute functionality

## Definition of Done

- [x] **Object cards designed** with name, definition, attributes, relationships
- [x] **Grid and list view toggles** working properly
- [x] **Filtering interface** by attributes, relationships, states
- [x] **Completion status indicators** showing object completeness
- [x] **Quick action buttons** for common operations
- [x] **Responsive design** working on desktop, tablet, mobile
- [x] **Performance optimized** for large object collections

## üéâ Implementation Summary
