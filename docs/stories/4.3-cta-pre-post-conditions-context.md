# Epic 4 Story 4.3: CTA Pre/Post Conditions & Context

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 4 - Roles & Call-to-Action Matrix  
**Story**: 4.3 - CTA Pre/Post Conditions & Context  
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025  
**Completed**: September 2, 2025

## User Story

As a **business analyst**,
I want **to define conditions and context around call-to-actions**,
So that **we capture the business rules governing user interactions**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Each CTA supports optional preconditions** (what must be true before action)
2. **Each CTA supports optional postconditions** (what changes after action)
3. **Conditions are free-text fields** supporting business rule descriptions

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **CTA detail view shows full context** including conditions
5. **Export includes all CTA context** and conditions
6. **Search functionality helps find CTAs** by verb, conditions, or context

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Condition editing interface is intuitive** with clear labeling and help text
8. **Validation ensures conditions are meaningful** when provided
9. **No performance degradation** when adding condition fields

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend existing CTA model with condition fields
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Epic 4.1 CTA schema already includes preconditions/postconditions
