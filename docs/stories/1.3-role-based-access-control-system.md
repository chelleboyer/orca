**READY FOR STORY 1.4** - All foundational security and collaboration features complete.  

## User Story

As a **project facilitator**,  
I want **to invite team members and assign them appropriate roles**,  
so that **I can control who can view, contribute to, or manage my OOUX projects**.

## Business Context

This story implements the collaborative foundation of the OOUX ORCA platform by enabling project facilitators to build teams with appropriate access levels. Role-based access control is essential for enterprise adoption and ensures that sensitive project data is only accessible to authorized team members with appropriate permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: User Invitation System ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Facilitators can invite users via email through `/api/v1/projects/{id}/invite` endpoint
- [x] Invitation includes role assignment: facilitator, contributor, or viewer
- [x] System generates unique invitation tokens with 7-day expiration
- [x] Invitation emails contain project details and acceptance link
- [x] Non-registered users can accept invitation and register simultaneously
- [x] Existing users can accept invitation to join project

### AC2: Role-Based Permissions ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Facilitator Role**: Full access - manage members, edit all content, delete project
- [x] **Contributor Role**: Edit access - create/edit OOUX artifacts, view all content

- [x] Users can leave projects voluntarily via DELETE `/api/v1/projects/{id}/members/me`
- [x] Last facilitator cannot be removed unless transferring ownership
- [x] Membership changes trigger email notifications to affected users

### AC4: Invitation Management ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Invitation acceptance creates project membership and marks invitation as used
- [x] Expired invitations are automatically cleaned up and marked as expired

- [x] Database queries automatically filter content based on user access level
- [x] API responses include user's role and permissions for frontend state management
- [x] Audit log tracks all permission changes and access attempts
- [x] Role changes take effect immediately without requiring re-authentication

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Project memberships table (extends existing from architecture)
CREATE TABLE project_memberships (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role membership_role NOT NULL,
    joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    invited_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    permissions JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    UNIQUE(project_id, user_id)
);

-- Project invitations table
CREATE TABLE project_invitations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role membership_role NOT NULL,
    token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    invited_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    accepted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    accepted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    status invitation_status DEFAULT 'pending'
);

-- Enums for roles and invitation status
CREATE TYPE membership_role AS ENUM ('facilitator', 'contributor', 'viewer');
CREATE TYPE invitation_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'accepted', 'expired', 'revoked');

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_project_memberships_project_user ON project_memberships(project_id, user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_invitations_token ON project_invitations(token);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_invitations_email ON project_invitations(email);
```

### API Endpoints

### Permission System Implementation

#### Role-Based Decorators
```python
from functools import wraps
from app.core.permissions import require_role, get_user_role

@require_role(['facilitator'])
async def delete_project(project_id: str, current_user: User):
    # Only facilitators can delete projects
    pass

@require_role(['facilitator', 'contributor'])  
async def create_object(project_id: str, current_user: User):
    # Facilitators and contributors can create objects
    pass

@require_role(['facilitator', 'contributor', 'viewer'])
async def get_project(project_id: str, current_user: User):
    # All project members can view project
    pass
```

#### Permission Matrix
```python
ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
    'facilitator': [
        'manage_members', 'invite_users', 'modify_roles', 'delete_project',
        'edit_content', 'create_content', 'delete_content', 'view_content',
        'export_data', 'manage_settings'
    ],
    'contributor': [
        'edit_content', 'create_content', 'view_content', 'export_data'
    ],
    'viewer': [
        'view_content', 'export_data'
    ]
}
```

## Dependencies
- **Story 1.1**: User authentication system must be complete
- **Story 1.2**: Project creation system must be available
- **Email Service**: SMTP configuration for invitation emails
- **Database**: Project and User models from previous stories

## Technical Notes for Developer

### Permission Strategy
Implement a flexible permission system that can be extended for future OOUX-specific permissions (like matrix editing, export controls, etc.).

### Invitation Security
Use cryptographically secure tokens for invitations and implement proper expiration handling to prevent unauthorized access.

### Role Hierarchy
Design the role system to be extensible - future stories may need additional roles or permission granularity.

### Email Templates
Create a template system that supports both plain text and HTML emails for better user experience and accessibility.

### Database Performance
Add appropriate indexes for membership queries since these will be checked on every project-related request.
