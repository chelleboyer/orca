2. ✅ Contributors can add multiple synonyms per object
3. ✅ Synonym search helps users find objects by alternative names
4. ✅ Definitions support basic markdown formatting for clarity
5. ✅ System prevents duplicate synonyms within a project
6. ✅ Object detail view shows full definition and all synonyms

## Dev Notes

### Data Models
**Source:** `app/models/object.py` - Existing implementation
- ObjectSynonym model with foreign key to Object
- Unique constraints on (object_id, synonym) combination
- Audit fields (created_at, created_by) for tracking
- Proper cascade deletes maintain data integrity
- Text field with 255 character limit for synonyms
- Extended Object.definition field to Text type for multi-line support

### API Specifications
**Source:** `app/api/v1/objects.py` - Existing implementation
- POST `/api/v1/objects/{id}/synonyms` - Add new synonym
- DELETE `/api/v1/synonyms/{id}` - Remove synonym
- Enhanced object responses include synonym collections
- Search endpoints support synonym matching
- Proper validation prevents duplicate synonyms per project

### Component Specifications
**Source:** `app/schemas/object.py` - Existing implementation
- ObjectSynonymCreate schema with validation rules
- ObjectSynonymResponse schema for API responses
- Enhanced ObjectResponse includes synonyms array
- Search schemas support synonym-based filtering
- Validation prevents empty or overly long synonyms

### File Locations
**Source:** Project structure analysis
- Synonym model: `app/models/object.py` (ObjectSynonym class)
- Synonym schemas: `app/schemas/object.py` 
- Synonym endpoints: `app/api/v1/objects.py`
