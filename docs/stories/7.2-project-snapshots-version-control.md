# Epic 7 Story 7.2: Project Snapshots & Version Control

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 7 - Collaboration & Export System  
**Story**: 7.2 - Project Snapshots & Version Control  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025

## User Story

As a **facilitator**,
I want **to create immutable snapshots of project state**,
So that **I can track progress, revert changes, and create milestone versions**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Facilitators can create named snapshots** with descriptions and timestamps
2. **Snapshots capture complete project state**: objects, relationships, CTAs, attributes, prioritization
3. **Snapshot browser allows viewing** and comparing historical versions

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Snapshot restoration creates new project branch** rather than overwriting current state
5. **Automatic snapshots trigger** at major milestones (round completion)
6. **Snapshot data includes user attribution** and change summaries

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Snapshot creation is fast** and doesn't block ongoing work
8. **Snapshot storage is efficient** and doesn't consume excessive space
9. **Snapshot restoration is reliable** and complete

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create snapshot system capturing all artifact data
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Project management and data export patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must capture state from all completed epics (objects, relationships, CTAs, attributes, prioritization)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Snapshot creation functionality** for facilitators
- [ ] **Complete project state capture** including all artifacts
