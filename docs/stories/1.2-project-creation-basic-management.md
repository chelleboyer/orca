# Story 1.2: Project Creation & Basic Management

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Completed:** August 31, 2025  

## User Story

As a **facilitator/lead**,  
I want **to create new OOUX projects with basic metadata**,  
so that **I can organize my team's OOUX work into distinct project contexts**.

## Business Context

This story builds upon the authentication foundation to enable the core functionality of project management. Projects are the primary organizational unit in the OOUX ORCA platform - each project represents a separate OOUX initiative with its own artifacts, team members, and progress tracking. Without project creation capabilities, users cannot begin their OOUX work or organize their efforts effectively.

This story delivers immediate value by allowing authenticated users to create and manage multiple projects, establishing the workspace concept that all subsequent OOUX features will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Project Creation
- [x] Authenticated users can create new projects via `/api/v1/projects` endpoint
- [x] Project creation requires title (3-100 characters) and optional description (max 1000 characters)
- [x] System generates unique project identifier (UUID) and human-readable slug from title
- [x] Project creator is automatically assigned "facilitator" role with full permissions
- [x] Created projects include metadata: creation date, last modified date, creator information
- [x] Project creation validates input and returns appropriate success/error responses

### AC2: Project Listing & Discovery
- [x] Users can retrieve list of their accessible projects via `/api/v1/projects` endpoint
- [x] Project list shows title, description, creation date, last modified, member count, and user's role
- [x] Projects are sorted by last modified date (most recent first) by default
- [x] Pagination support for users with many projects (20 projects per page)
- [x] Search functionality allows filtering projects by title or description
- [x] Projects display status indicators (active, archived, in-progress)

### AC3: Project Metadata Management
- [x] Project facilitators can update project title and description via PUT `/api/v1/projects/{id}`
- [x] Project metadata updates automatically update the "last_modified" timestamp
- [x] System validates project ownership/facilitator permissions before allowing edits
- [x] Project slug is regenerated when title changes (with conflict resolution)
- [x] Edit operations return updated project data and success confirmation
- [x] Project history tracking records all metadata changes with timestamps

### AC4: Project Access & Routing
- [x] Projects are accessible via unique URLs: `/projects/{project_slug}` or `/projects/{project_id}`
- [x] System validates user permissions before granting project access
- [x] Project access returns 404 for non-existent projects and 403 for unauthorized access
- [x] Project detail endpoint returns full project information including member list
- [x] URL routing supports both slug-based and ID-based project access
- [x] Project URLs are SEO-friendly and human-readable

### AC5: Basic Project Status & Health
- [x] Project health check endpoint `/api/v1/projects/{id}/status` returns project status
- [x] Status includes: total artifacts, completion percentage, last activity date, active members
- [x] Projects track "last activity" timestamp for any project-related actions
- [x] Basic progress indicators show OOUX workflow completion (0% initially)
- [x] Project dashboard displays key metrics and quick actions for the user's role
- [x] System provides basic project analytics: creation trends, activity patterns

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    slug VARCHAR(120) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_activity TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'archived', 'deleted')),
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);

-- Project memberships (roles and permissions)
CREATE TABLE project_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('facilitator', 'contributor', 'viewer')),
    invited_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    invited_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'active', 'inactive')),
    
    UNIQUE(project_id, user_id)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_created_by ON projects(created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_slug ON projects(slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_status ON projects(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_updated_at ON projects(updated_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_members_project_id ON project_members(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_members_user_id ON project_members(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_members_role ON project_members(role);
```

- [x] Manual testing confirms all project workflows function correctly

## Dependencies
- **Authentication System**: Story 1.1 must be complete (User model and auth system)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection with User table established
- **Session Management**: JWT authentication for API endpoint protection

## Technical Notes for Developer

### Slug Generation
Implement URL-friendly slug generation from project titles with automatic conflict resolution. Use a combination of title-based slugs and UUID suffixes when conflicts occur.

### Permission Architecture
Design the permission system to be extensible for future role types and granular permissions. Consider implementing a simple RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system that can grow with the application.

### Database Relationships
Ensure proper foreign key relationships and cascade deletion policies. The Project model should be the central hub for future OOUX artifact relationships.

### API Design
Follow RESTful principles and maintain consistency with the existing authentication API. Use proper HTTP status codes and implement comprehensive error handling.

### Performance Considerations
Implement efficient database queries with proper indexing for project listings and searches. Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed project data.
