# Epic 6 Story 6.3: Representation Validation & Completeness

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 6 - Prioritization & CDLL Representation  
**Story**: 6.3 - Representation Validation & Completeness  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025

## User Story

As a **facilitator**,
I want **to validate that our domain model is ready for implementation**,
So that **I can confidently hand off complete specifications to development teams**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **System checks each object** for minimum viable attributes and CTAs
2. **Validation reports identify gaps** in object definitions, relationships, or attributes
3. **Dependency analysis shows objects** that lack sufficient detail for CDLL generation

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Completion dashboard shows percentage complete** across all ORCA dimensions
5. **Export readiness indicator confirms** all critical artifacts are sufficiently defined
6. **Validation rules are configurable** based on project-specific requirements

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Validation is comprehensive** but not overly restrictive
8. **Progress indicators are accurate** and helpful for planning
9. **Export readiness is reliable** for development handoff

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Analyze all completed epic data for completeness
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Dashboard progress tracking patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must validate across objects, relationships, CTAs, attributes, and prioritization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Validation engine** checks objects for minimum viable completeness
- [ ] **Gap reporting** identifies missing definitions, relationships, attributes
- [ ] **Dependency analysis** shows objects needing more detail
- [ ] **Completion dashboard** with percentage progress across ORCA dimensions
- [ ] **Export readiness indicator** based on validation results
- [ ] **Configurable validation rules** for project-specific requirements
- [ ] **Validation results** integrated into project dashboard
