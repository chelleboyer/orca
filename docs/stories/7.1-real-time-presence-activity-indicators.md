# Epic 7 Story 7.1: Real-time Presence & Activity Indicators

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 7 - Collaboration & Export System  
**Story**: 7.1 - Real-time Presence & Activity Indicators  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025

## User Story

As a **team member**,
I want **to see who else is working on the project and what they're doing**,
So that **I can coordinate effectively and avoid conflicting work**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User presence indicators show** who is currently active in the project
2. **Activity feed displays recent changes** across all artifacts
3. **Current editing indicators show** who is working on specific objects/relationships

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Presence indicators appear** in Object Catalog, NOM, CTA Matrix, and other key views
5. **WebSocket updates provide real-time presence** without page refresh
6. **Idle timeout (15 minutes)** removes inactive users from presence display

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Presence updates are immediate** and accurate
8. **Activity feed is informative** without being overwhelming
9. **Performance impact is minimal** on existing functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Add WebSocket layer to existing HTMX infrastructure
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Epic 3.3 collaborative editing patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must integrate with all existing views without major refactoring

## Definition of Done
