# Epic 5 Story 5.2: Object Map Visual Representation

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 5 - Attributes & Object Map Visualization  
**Story**: 5.2 - Object Map Visual Representation  
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025  
**Started**: September 2, 2025  
**Completed**: September 3, 2025

## User Story

As a **stakeholder**,
I want **to see a visual map of objects with their core attributes and relationships**,
So that **I can understand the domain model at a glance**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Object Map displays objects as cards** showing name, definition, and core attributes
2. **Relationship lines connect objects** with cardinality labels
3. **Visual layout supports manual positioning** and auto-layout options

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Core attributes display prominently** with data type indicators
5. **Interactive elements allow navigation** to detailed object/relationship editing
6. **Map supports zoom, pan, and export** as PNG/SVG for presentations

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Visual layout is clear and readable** even with many objects
8. **Performance remains good** with complex object networks
9. **Export quality is presentation-ready** for stakeholder communication

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Build on completed Epic 2 (Objects) and Epic 3 (Relationships)
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Dashboard visualization patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must integrate with completed NOM and Object Catalog

## Definition of Done

- [x] **Object cards display** name, definition, core attributes
- [x] **Relationship visualization** with proper cardinality labels
- [x] **Interactive layout** with drag-and-drop positioning
- [x] **Auto-layout algorithm** for automatic arrangement
