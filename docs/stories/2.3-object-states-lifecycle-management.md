# Story 2.3: Object States & Lifecycle Management

**Epic:** Epic 2 - Core Object Modeling & Catalog  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  
**Sprint:** Sprint 2  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Completed:** January 25, 2025

## Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION** - All acceptance criteria delivered. Optional object state management system provides flexible lifecycle modeling for dynamic domain objects.

### Core Components Delivered
- ✅ **ObjectState Model**: Complete state management with ordering support
- ✅ **Optional State System**: States are completely optional, not all objects need them
- ✅ **State CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete for object states
- ✅ **State Ordering**: Configurable order for state display and progression
- ✅ **State Descriptions**: Optional descriptions for complex state meanings
- ✅ **Export Integration**: State information included in export systems

### State Management Features
| Feature | Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Add States** | POST `/api/v1/objects/{id}/states` | ✅ Complete |
| **List States** | Included in object detail responses | ✅ Complete |
| **Update States** | PUT `/api/v1/states/{id}` | ✅ Complete |
| **Remove States** | DELETE `/api/v1/states/{id}` | ✅ Complete |
| **State Ordering** | Order index field for custom sequencing | ✅ Complete |
| **Optional Usage** | Objects work perfectly without states | ✅ Complete |

### State System Characteristics
- ✅ **Completely Optional**: Objects function fully without any states defined
- ✅ **Simple Text Labels**: States are straightforward text identifiers
- ✅ **Optional Descriptions**: Additional context available when needed
- ✅ **Custom Ordering**: States can be arranged in logical sequences
- ✅ **Flexible Addition**: States can be added/removed after object creation
- ✅ **Export Ready**: State data integrates with export functionality

**EPIC 2 COMPLETE** - Object Catalog foundation complete with CRUD, definitions, synonyms, and optional state management.

## User Story

As a **domain expert**,  
I want **to define possible states for objects that have lifecycle changes**,  
so that **we can model dynamic objects that change over time**.

## Business Context

This story completes the Object Catalog by adding optional state management for objects that have meaningful lifecycle progression. Many domain objects are static concepts, but some (like Orders, Projects, Documents) benefit from explicit state modeling. This optional feature allows teams to capture state-dependent behavior without adding complexity to simple objects.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Objects can have optional state definitions (e.g., Draft, Published, Archived)
2. ✅ States are defined as simple text labels with optional descriptions
3. ✅ Object view indicates if states are defined vs. stateless objects
4. ✅ State management is optional - not all objects require states
5. ✅ States can be added, edited, or removed after object creation
6. ✅ Export includes state information when defined

## Dev Notes

### Data Models
**Source:** `app/models/object.py` - Existing implementation
- ObjectState model with foreign key to Object
- state_name field (String, 100 chars) for simple labels
- Optional description field (Text) for additional context
- order_index field (String, 50 chars) for flexible ordering
- Audit fields (created_at, created_by) for change tracking
- Proper cascade deletes maintain data integrity

### API Specifications
**Source:** `app/api/v1/objects.py` - Existing implementation
- POST `/api/v1/objects/{id}/states` - Add state to object
- PUT `/api/v1/states/{id}` - Update existing state
- DELETE `/api/v1/states/{id}` - Remove state from object
- Enhanced object responses include states array
- State ordering preserved in API responses

### Component Specifications
**Source:** `app/schemas/object.py` - Existing implementation
- ObjectStateCreate schema with validation rules
- ObjectStateResponse schema for API responses
- Enhanced ObjectResponse includes states array
- Order index supports flexible state sequencing
- Validation ensures state names are appropriate

### File Locations
**Source:** Project structure analysis

- State schemas: `app/schemas/object.py`
- State endpoints: `app/api/v1/objects.py`
- State service logic: `app/services/object_service.py`
- Database migration: `alembic/versions/` (state table)

### Testing Requirements
**Source:** FastAPI testing patterns
- Unit tests for state business logic
- API tests for state CRUD operations
- Tests for objects without states (optional nature)
- State ordering and validation tests
- Export integration tests with state data

### Technical Constraints
**Source:** Architecture documents
- States completely optional - no performance impact on stateless objects
- State names limited to 100 characters for UI consistency
- Order index allows flexible sequencing without database migrations
- All state operations require proper authentication
- Export systems handle both stateful and stateless objects

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
- `test_object_states.py`: Test state business logic and validation
- `test_optional_states.py`: Test objects without states work properly
- `test_state_ordering.py`: Test state sequence management

### Integration Tests Required
- `test_state_api.py`: Test state management API endpoints
- `test_export_with_states.py`: Test export functionality includes states
- `test_state_lifecycle.py`: Test complete state management workflows

### Test Data Requirements
- Objects with various state configurations for testing
- Objects without states to verify optional nature
- State ordering scenarios for sequence testing
