# Epic 5 Story 5.1: Attribute Definition & Management

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 5 - Attributes & Object Map Visualization  
**Story**: 5.1 - Attribute Definition & Management  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025

## User Story

As a **contributor**,
I want **to define attributes for objects with data types and properties**,
So that **we can specify the data structure of our domain objects**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Objects support adding multiple attributes** with name, data type, and required flag
2. **Supported data types include**: Text, Number, Date, Boolean, Reference, List
3. **Attributes can be marked as "core"** for prominent display in Object Map

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Attribute reordering affects display order** in Object Map and exports
5. **Reference attributes can link** to other objects in the catalog
6. **Bulk attribute operations** (import/export, templates) support efficiency

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Attribute management interface is intuitive** with clear data type selection
8. **Validation prevents duplicate attribute names** within an object
9. **Performance remains good** with large numbers of attributes per object

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend existing Object model with attributes relationship
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow Object Catalog CRUD patterns from Epic 2
- **Key Constraints**: Must integrate with completed Object Catalog functionality

## Definition of Done
