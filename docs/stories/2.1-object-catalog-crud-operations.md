---

## User Story

As a **contributor**,  
I want **to create, view, edit, and delete objects in the project catalog**,  
so that **I can build and maintain the foundational object model for our domain**.

## Business Context

This story establishes the foundational Object Catalog that serves as the cornerstone of the OOUX methodology. Contributors need reliable CRUD operations to manage domain objects with proper validation, permissions, and audit trails. This foundation enables the team to collaboratively define their domain model as the first step in the OOUX process.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Contributors can create new objects with name and initial definition
2. ✅ Object Catalog displays all project objects in a searchable, sortable table
3. ✅ Users can edit object names and definitions with inline editing capabilities
4. ✅ Object deletion requires confirmation and checks for dependencies
5. ✅ Object names must be unique within a project
6. ✅ System tracks creation and modification timestamps for audit
