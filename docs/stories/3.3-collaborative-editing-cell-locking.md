## User Story

As a **contributor working with teammates**,  
I want **to see when others are editing relationships and avoid conflicts**,  
so that **our team can collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other's work**.

## Business Context

This story completes Epic 3 by enabling real-time collaborative editing of the NOM matrix. Teams often work together on relationship mapping during OOUX workshops, and proper collaboration features ensure that multiple contributors can work simultaneously without conflicts, data loss, or confusion about who is editing what.
