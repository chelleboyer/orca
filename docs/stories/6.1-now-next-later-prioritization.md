# Epic 6 Story 6.1: Now/Next/Later Prioritization

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 6 - Prioritization & CDLL Representation  
**Story**: 6.1 - Now/Next/Later Prioritization  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025

## User Story

As a **product owner**,
I want **to prioritize objects, CTAs, and attributes into development phases**,
So that **we can plan implementation based on business value and dependencies**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Prioritization interface allows dragging items** between Now/Next/Later columns
2. **All objects, CTAs, and attributes can be independently prioritized**
3. **Optional scoring (1-10)** provides additional prioritization detail

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Prioritization view supports filtering** by item type and current assignment
5. **Bulk operations enable efficient categorization** of multiple items
6. **Priority changes reflect immediately** in other views and exports

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Drag-and-drop interface is intuitive** and responsive
8. **Bulk operations are efficient** for large item collections
9. **Priority data persists reliably** across sessions

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Add prioritization layer to all existing artifacts
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Dashboard interaction patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must work with objects, CTAs, and attributes from all previous epics

## Definition of Done
