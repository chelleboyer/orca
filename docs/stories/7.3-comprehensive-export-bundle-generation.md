# Epic 7 Story 7.3: Comprehensive Export Bundle Generation

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 7 - Collaboration & Export System  
**Story**: 7.3 - Comprehensive Export Bundle Generation  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025

## User Story

As a **stakeholder**,
I want **to export complete project data in multiple formats**,
So that **I can use OOUX artifacts in development tools, presentations, and documentation**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Export generates ZIP bundle** containing: project.json, objects.csv, relationships.csv, ctas.csv, attributes.csv
2. **Bundle includes Mermaid ERD file** showing complete relationship diagram
3. **Object Map exports as interactive HTML** with embedded styles and navigation

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **CDLL previews export as individual HTML files** per object
5. **Export process completes within 30 seconds** for projects up to 100 objects
6. **Download progress indicator and error handling** provide clear user feedback

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Export files are well-formatted** and immediately usable
8. **Export bundle is comprehensive** including all project artifacts
9. **Export performance is acceptable** even for large projects

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Build comprehensive export using all completed epic data
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Data export and download patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must export data from all epics (objects, relationships, CTAs, attributes, prioritization, CDLL previews)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **ZIP bundle generation** with all required file formats
- [ ] **JSON, CSV export** for all artifact types
- [ ] **Mermaid ERD generation** showing complete relationship diagram
- [ ] **Interactive HTML Object Map** export
- [ ] **CDLL preview HTML files** for each object
- [ ] **30-second performance target** for projects up to 100 objects
- [ ] **Progress indicator and error handling** for export process
