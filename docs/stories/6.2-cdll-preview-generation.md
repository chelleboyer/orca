# Epic 6 Story 6.2: CDLL Preview Generation

## Story Overview

**Epic**: 6 - Prioritization & CDLL Representation  
**Story**: 6.2 - CDLL Preview Generation  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Created**: September 1, 2025

## User Story

As a **designer/developer**,
I want **to see how objects translate to user interface patterns**,
So that **I can understand the implementation implications of our domain model**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **System generates Card, Detail, List, and Landing previews** for each object
2. **Previews use core attributes and primary CTAs** to build realistic interfaces
3. **Missing core attributes trigger warnings** with suggestions for completion

**Integration Requirements:**
4. **Preview styling follows basic design patterns** appropriate for object types
5. **CDLL previews export as HTML** with embedded CSS for developer handoff
6. **Preview generation respects prioritization** (Now items get full previews)

**Quality Requirements:**
7. **Preview generation is fast** and doesn't block the interface
8. **Generated HTML is clean** and developer-friendly
9. **Warnings are helpful** and actionable for completeness

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Build on Epic 5 attributes and Epic 6.1 prioritization
