**READY FOR EPIC 2** - Complete foundation with dashboard, navigation, and team collaboration features.  

## User Story

As a **project member**,  
I want **to view project status and navigate to different OOUX artifacts**,  
so that **I can understand project progress and access the tools I need**.

## Business Context

This story completes Epic 1 by creating the central hub for OOUX project work.

## Technical Notes for Developer

### Caching Strategy
Implement multi-layer caching - Redis for dashboard data, HTTP caching for static assets, and client-side caching for navigation state.

### Progressive Enhancement
Build the dashboard to work without JavaScript, then enhance with HTMX and WebSocket features for better user experience.

### Extensibility
Design the navigation and progress tracking to easily accommodate new OOUX methodology sections in future epics.

### Performance Monitoring
Add performance monitoring hooks to track dashboard load times and identify optimization opportunities.

### Mobile-First Design
Start with mobile layout constraints and enhance for larger screens to ensure excellent mobile experience.
