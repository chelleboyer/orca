# OOUX ORCA Project Builder Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable teams to collaboratively work through Sophia Prater's OOUX ORCA process with structured guidance
- Reduce domain modeling ambiguity early in the product development process through object-first approach
- Support both beginner-friendly guided workflows and expert-level freeform navigation
- Maintain artifact consistency and linkage throughout the ORCA process (Objects → Relationships → CTAs → Attributes)
- Generate comprehensive exports for development handoff and stakeholder communication

### Background Context
The OOUX (Object-Oriented User Experience) methodology, specifically the ORCA process, provides a systematic approach to understanding and modeling complex domains before diving into implementation. Many teams struggle with ambiguous requirements and misaligned mental models, leading to costly rework and user experience issues. This collaborative web application guides teams through the four rounds of ORCA (Discovery → Requirements → Prioritization → Representation) while maintaining artifact consistency and enabling both structured guidance for newcomers and flexible navigation for experienced practitioners.

**NFR8:** Page load times must not exceed 3 seconds on standard broadband connections

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, collaborative workspace that balances structured guidance with expert flexibility. The interface should feel like a sophisticated project management tool with specialized domain modeling capabilities, emphasizing clarity in complex relationship visualization and seamless transitions between different ORCA artifacts.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Matrix-based editing** with HTMX partials for real-time collaborative cell updates
- **Progressive disclosure** supporting both guided step-by-step flows and expert jump-to-any-section navigation
- **Visual relationship mapping** using interactive grids and connection indicators
- **Contextual dependency awareness** with banner notifications and visual gap indicators
- **Snapshot/versioning workflow** with clear visual states for draft vs published artifacts

### Core Screens and Views
- **Project Dashboard** - Progress overview, artifact status, team presence, and navigation hub
- **Object Catalog** - Tabular view with inline editing for object definitions, synonyms, and states
- **Nested Object Matrix (NOM)** - Interactive grid for relationship mapping with cardinality controls
- **CTA Matrix** - Role-object intersection grid with expandable cells for action details
- **Object Map & Attributes** - Visual object cards showing core attributes and relationships
- **Prioritization Table** - Sortable/filterable view for Now/Next/Later slicing with scoring
- **Representation Previews** - CDLL mockups per object with missing-field warnings
- **Export Center** - Bundle configuration and download interface

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Target WCAG AA compliance to ensure professional usability across diverse teams, with particular attention to color contrast in matrix visualizations and keyboard navigation for complex grid interactions.

### Branding
Clean, professional interface emphasizing data clarity and collaborative workflow. Visual hierarchy should support both detail-focused work (matrix editing) and high-level overview (progress tracking). Consider OOUX methodology visual conventions where applicable.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Responsive web application optimized for desktop collaboration with tablet support for review workflows. Mobile support for read-only access and basic commenting/approval functions.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both frontend and backend Python code, shared documentation, and deployment configurations. This supports tight integration between the collaborative matrix interfaces and real-time backend coordination.

### Service Architecture: Monolith
Python-based monolithic application leveraging frameworks like FastAPI for backend APIs and a Python web framework (Django/Flask) or Python-compiled frontend solution. Given the tight coupling between collaborative features (presence, locking, real-time updates) and complex domain relationships, a monolithic approach simplifies development and deployment for MVP.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
Comprehensive testing covering both individual component logic (matrix operations, export generation, relationship validation) and integration between collaborative features (WebSocket coordination, data consistency, concurrent editing conflict resolution).

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Backend Framework:** FastAPI for high-performance async API handling real-time collaboration requirements

**Frontend Approach:** Python-based frontend solution (Pyodide/PyScript, Streamlit, or Django templates with HTMX) to maintain full-stack Python consistency

**Real-time Communication:** WebSockets for presence indicators, collaborative editing, and live updates

**Database:** PostgreSQL for robust relational data modeling supporting complex object relationships and ACID transactions for collaborative editing

**Session Management:** Redis for managing user presence, collaborative locks, and session state

**Export Generation:** Python libraries for JSON serialization, CSV generation (pandas), Mermaid diagram creation, and HTML template rendering

**Development Environment:** Docker containerization for consistent development and deployment across team members

**Deployment Target:** Container-ready deployment (Docker/Kubernetes) supporting horizontal scaling for collaborative features

**File Storage:** Local filesystem or cloud storage (S3-compatible) for generated export bundles and project snapshots
