# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, collaborative workspace that balances structured guidance with expert flexibility. The interface should feel like a sophisticated project management tool with specialized domain modeling capabilities, emphasizing clarity in complex relationship visualization and seamless transitions between different ORCA artifacts.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Matrix-based editing** with HTMX partials for real-time collaborative cell updates
- **Progressive disclosure** supporting both guided step-by-step flows and expert jump-to-any-section navigation
- **Visual relationship mapping** using interactive grids and connection indicators
- **Contextual dependency awareness** with banner notifications and visual gap indicators
- **Snapshot/versioning workflow** with clear visual states for draft vs published artifacts

## Core Screens and Views
- **Project Dashboard** - Progress overview, artifact status, team presence, and navigation hub
- **Object Catalog** - Tabular view with inline editing for object definitions, synonyms, and states
- **Nested Object Matrix (NOM)** - Interactive grid for relationship mapping with cardinality controls
- **CTA Matrix** - Role-object intersection grid with expandable cells for action details
- **Object Map & Attributes** - Visual object cards showing core attributes and relationships
- **Prioritization Table** - Sortable/filterable view for Now/Next/Later slicing with scoring
- **Representation Previews** - CDLL mockups per object with missing-field warnings
- **Export Center** - Bundle configuration and download interface

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Target WCAG AA compliance to ensure professional usability across diverse teams, with particular attention to color contrast in matrix visualizations and keyboard navigation for complex grid interactions.

## Branding
Clean, professional interface emphasizing data clarity and collaborative workflow. Visual hierarchy should support both detail-focused work (matrix editing) and high-level overview (progress tracking). Consider OOUX methodology visual conventions where applicable.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Responsive web application optimized for desktop collaboration with tablet support for review workflows. Mobile support for read-only access and basic commenting/approval functions.
