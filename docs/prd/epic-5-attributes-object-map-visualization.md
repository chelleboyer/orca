# Epic 5: Attributes & Object Map Visualization

**Epic Goal:** Add attribute management to objects and create visual Object Map representations that show the complete domain model with relationships and key attributes.

## Story 5.1: Attribute Definition & Management

As a **contributor**,
I want **to define attributes for objects with data types and properties**,
so that **we can specify the data structure of our domain objects**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Objects support adding multiple attributes with name, data type, and required flag
2. Supported data types include: Text, Number, Date, Boolean, Reference, List
3. Attributes can be marked as "core" for prominent display in Object Map
4. Attribute reordering affects display order in Object Map and exports
5. Reference attributes can link to other objects in the catalog
6. Bulk attribute operations (import/export, templates) support efficiency

## Story 5.2: Object Map Visual Representation

As a **stakeholder**,
I want **to see a visual map of objects with their core attributes and relationships**,
so that **I can understand the domain model at a glance**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Object Map displays objects as cards showing name, definition, and core attributes
2. Relationship lines connect objects with cardinality labels
3. Visual layout supports manual positioning and auto-layout options
4. Core attributes display prominently with data type indicators
5. Interactive elements allow navigation to detailed object/relationship editing
6. Map supports zoom, pan, and export as PNG/SVG for presentations

## Story 5.3: Object Cards & Attribute Display

As a **team member**,
I want **to see object information in card format with key details**,
so that **I can quickly understand object structure without detailed editing**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Object cards show name, definition summary, core attributes, and relationship count
2. Card view supports grid and list layouts for different use cases
3. Filtering by attributes, relationships, or states helps find relevant objects
4. Cards indicate completion status (has definition, attributes, relationships)
5. Quick actions on cards enable common operations without full editing
6. Card design supports responsive display on various screen sizes
