# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish secure project infrastructure with user authentication, role-based access control, and basic project management capabilities. This epic delivers immediate value through project creation and user management while setting up the foundational architecture for collaborative OOUX workflows.

## Story 1.1: User Registration & Authentication System

As a **facilitator/team member**,
I want **to register an account and securely log in**,
so that **I can access the OOUX ORCA platform and maintain my project data securely**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can register with email, password, and display name
2. System validates email format and password strength requirements
3. Users can log in with email/password combination
4. System maintains secure session management with automatic logout after inactivity
5. Password reset functionality via email verification
6. User profile displays name and email with edit capabilities

## Story 1.2: Project Creation & Basic Management

As a **facilitator/lead**,
I want **to create new OOUX projects with basic metadata**,
so that **I can organize my team's OOUX work into distinct project contexts**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Authenticated users can create new projects with title and description
2. Project creator is automatically assigned facilitator role
3. Projects display creation date, last modified date, and creator information
4. Facilitators can edit project title and description
5. System generates unique project identifiers for URL routing
6. Basic project health check endpoint returns project status

## Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control System

As a **project facilitator**,
I want **to invite team members and assign them appropriate roles**,
so that **I can control who can view, contribute to, or manage my OOUX projects**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Facilitators can invite users by email to projects with role assignment (facilitator/contributor/viewer)
2. Invited users receive email invitations with project access links
3. System enforces role-based permissions: facilitators (full access), contributors (edit artifacts), viewers (read-only)
4. Project member list displays all users with their roles and invitation status
5. Facilitators can modify user roles or remove users from projects
6. Access control validates permissions on all project operations

## Story 1.4: Project Dashboard & Navigation Foundation

As a **project member**,
I want **to view project status and navigate to different OOUX artifacts**,
so that **I can understand project progress and access the tools I need**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Project dashboard displays project metadata, member list, and role-based action buttons
2. Navigation menu shows available OOUX sections (Object Catalog, NOM, CTA Matrix, etc.) with progress indicators
3. Dashboard indicates which ORCA rounds are complete/in-progress/not-started
4. Users see role-appropriate functionality based on their project permissions
5. Responsive layout works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
6. Loading states and error handling provide clear user feedback
