# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable teams to collaboratively work through Sophia Prater's OOUX ORCA process with structured guidance
- Reduce domain modeling ambiguity early in the product development process through object-first approach
- Support both beginner-friendly guided workflows and expert-level freeform navigation
- Maintain artifact consistency and linkage throughout the ORCA process (Objects → Relationships → CTAs → Attributes)
- Generate comprehensive exports for development handoff and stakeholder communication

## Background Context
The OOUX (Object-Oriented User Experience) methodology, specifically the ORCA process, provides a systematic approach to understanding and modeling complex domains before diving into implementation. Many teams struggle with ambiguous requirements and misaligned mental models, leading to costly rework and user experience issues. This collaborative web application guides teams through the four rounds of ORCA (Discovery → Requirements → Prioritization → Representation) while maintaining artifact consistency and enabling both structured guidance for newcomers and flexible navigation for experienced practitioners.
